TODO sketch for this branch, in rough priority order:

- Allow padding on specific circuit purposes and to specific hops
- Allow padding events to start/stop padding based on circuit
  construction state and stream usage.
- Check https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25505 for
  more accurate event sources
- Support torrc load+serialization of state machines
- Support consensus load+serialization of state machines
- Come up with some good histograms for eg circuit setup fingerprinting,
  website fingerprinting, and vanguards usage.
- Experiment with run-length histograms and other histogram/distribution
  encoding methods.
- Verify padding comes from correct hop for dropped cell accounting:
