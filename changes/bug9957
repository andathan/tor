  o Minor bugfixes (transport proxies):
    - Have Tor log the stderr output of transport proxies.
      Previously we ignored standard error streams of transport proxies.
      This would sometimes cause confusion when they would fail
      prematurely (e.g. obfsproxy tracebacks get dumped to stderr.) We now
      make a notice when there's stderr output, and we log the output
      itself at INFO level. Implements ticket 9957.
